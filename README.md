# CO1111 – The Computing Challenge

## Introduction

This project is a robust and dynamic web application built with React, TypeScript, Redux, and other modern web technologies. It is a Treasure Hunt Web App that provides an online quiz where the answers depend on finding information at specific locations. The app uses a given API to access the clues (questions) and compete by submitting answers.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- etc.

## Features

- A reasonable landing page that clearly explains the scope of the project, lists the team members and their roles, and explains the digital marketing efforts to promote the project.
- An implementation of a JavaScript-based Web App that allows you to play a full session of treasure hunt.
- A testing page which includes notes of testing efforts.
- Extra features such as a QR Code reader, a map of the locations visited so far, and a leaderboard showing the points of other players.
